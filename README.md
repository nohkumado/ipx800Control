# ipx800Control
Ipx800 library to easily call the m2m commands of this domotic contoller

should be usable at least for the m2m commands, as usual "it works for me" (tm)

just add the jar-file to your project , or the ipx800Control.java file instantiate an ipx800Control object
and fire up the different commands (as getIn, getOut, set, getCount etc. please extract the available commands from the javadoc of the class...)
